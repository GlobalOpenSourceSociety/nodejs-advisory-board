## Review of Action Items

Github repository identified that it has been set up. There was discussion about using the node.js organization in Github that is currently owned by Felix Geisend√∂rfer and about how that may be transition to the communal use.

Community feedback was provided regarding broadening the influence and input into the advisory board. Including a lot of discussion that was conducted through the new [Github repository](https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/)

The initial information around project governance and review has been posted. Significant discussion around [Issue 6 - Voting Model](https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/issues/6) and [Issue 13 - Project Governance and Contribution Policy](https://github.com/joyent/nodejs-advisory-board/pull/13) and where they currently sit.

Danese was unfortunately not available, Scott provided a quick review of the status of the trademark discussions. The working group walked through the current policy and identified the need for more clarification on acceptable use to encompass professional services and products. The group will utilize Mongo, Eclipse, and Docker as examples projects to draw from. Agreed that there is no certification products and since there is no process to do that, there will be no certification for training or product compatibility. Project teams should be publishing the acceptance testing and organizations that want to test against the test suite and should be posting the results to the node.js repo. Implementors are solely responsible for bug fixes, testing, etc. for their projects and the node.js project team is not responsible for those items.
