Foundation is moving full steam ahead
Thanks to Mikeal for help in communicating out a statement for the need for the Foundation -- very well done.
io.js voted in favor of moving io.js work into Node.js Foundation
All signs are very strong in terms of tech communities coming together
Last week’s joint TC call went well -- solid planning and discussion, very few disruptive questions left, making progress towards reunification
Working with Casey who is helping update Node.js website to include things under Foundation section (now in menu) -- still continuing to build out content and get initial content up
Signing package is complete (now on Node.js website)
Working on form to capture membership inquiries
3 members have officially signed up
MR:  Do companies have to sign agreement to be part of announcement, or just state intent?  MD:  Signed agreements are needed to be part of the announcement.
DI:  What is launch target more specific that early-June?  SN:  Has not been finalized.
CO:  Is there a calendar of dates anywhere where things are scheduled to happen?  Yes -- go to Nodejs.org -- new tab for Foundation.

## Individual Members
DS:  Is there a way for non-corporate to participate in foundation?
MR:  In deck it says there can be individual members
DC:  This needs to get ironed out so there isn’t the perception of “it is only big companies”
MD:  What does an individual member get that a contributor in the community does not?  Can we ask the Community WG to define this?
CO:  We could start of with tshirt and nodejs email address?
MD:  Define 1-3 things that are benefits of individual member and what is the price point?  LUGs put on by members of org (individual member can get access to package/funds)
MD:  Community WG to pull this together, driven by CO to start writing this up.
MR:  When it gets written up, put on repo called “membership”
MR:  Creating a repo and adding Cian to it https://github.com/nodejs/membership

## Community WG
Danese still needs to be added to Community WG.
MD:  Who else has been involved?
DC:  Dan has mainly been driving
TO:  I set up doodle…. 11am Wednesday seems to be best for everyone.
DC:  Will be flying then.
MR:  Can’t make it then either.
CO:  Also on plane
MR:  What is charter outside of figuring out membership?
DC:  Help filtering community needs upwards.
CO:  Who organizes doodle poll?  Cian has someone named Guy that can help.
MD:  In next AB meeting, Guy can give a Community WG update.

## Open Discussion
TO:  What is the purpose of Associate Membership?
MD:  Usually there for academic institutions or other non-profit orgs.  Generally undefined, and Board later defines.  Could do a start-up membership tier (i.e. under xx employees or xx revenue).
Other WGs that may need help?
MR:  Website WG needs help.
